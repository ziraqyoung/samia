  # This line mounts Spree's routes at the root of your application.
  # This means, any requests to URLs such as /products, will go to
  # Spree::ProductsController.
  # If you would like to change where this engine is mounted, simply change the
  # :at option to something different.
  #
  # We ask that you don't use the :as option here, as Spree relies on it being
  # the default of "spree".

  # Sidekiq has a web dashboard which you can enable below. It's turned off by
  # default because you very likely wouldn't want this to be available to
  # everyone in production.
  #
  # Uncomment the 2 lines below to enable the dashboard WITHOUT authentication,
  # but be careful because even anonymous web visitors will be able to see it!
  # require 'sidekiq/web'
  # mount Sidekiq::Web => '/sidekiq'
  #
  # If you add Devise to this project and happen to have an admin? attribute
  # on your user you can uncomment the 4 lines below to only allow access to
  # the dashboard if you're an admin. Feel free to adjust things as needed.
  # require 'sidekiq/web'
  # authenticate :user, lambda { |u| u.admin? } do
  #   mount Sidekiq::Web => '/sidekiq'
